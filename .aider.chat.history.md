#### Necesito arreglar el resumen de IA que se trunca a 300 tokens.   
####   
#### PROBLEMA:  
#### - En ai_engine_groq.py, generate_text() usa max_tokens=300 diseñado para planos ASCII cortos  
#### - En project_detail.py línea ~303 usa generate_text() para informes largos  
#### - Resultado: Informe se corta a mitad  
####   
#### SOLUCIÓN:  
#### 1. En ai_engine_groq.py:   
####    - Añadir nueva función generate_project_report(prompt:  str) -> str  
####    - Parámetros: max_tokens=8000, temperature=0.7, sin stop sequence  
####    - System prompt: "Eres arquitecto profesional. Genera informes completos en markdown con títulos ##, listas y secciones claras. Incluye planos ASCII cuando sea apropiado.  NO trunces el informe."  
####    - Manejo de errores igual que generate_text()  
####   
#### 2. En project_detail.py:  
####    - Línea ~303: cambiar "summary = ai. generate_text(prompt)" por "summary = ai.generate_project_report(prompt)"  
####   
#### El objetivo es tener informes completos de 2000+ palabras sin truncar.
